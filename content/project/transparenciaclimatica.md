## Requirements
* A simple and clean institutional page that explains the purpose and work of the organization
* A custom visualization of tracked data related to sustainable development projects

## Solutions
This website is based on relatively simple custom Wordpress theme. The most important part was that the different sections of the website were easily editable by adding, editing or deleting different page components. In total there are about 15 different custom components, one of which is a custom data visualization. One interesting aspect of this visualization is the use of multiple background colors in the same `svg path` depending on the data available for a particular country.
