Naturally curious and a quick learner, I am always looking for a new challenge. With a strong background in data analysis, my main focus and interest lie in the clear and concise communication of new data insights. Additionally, due to my background in education, I have the organizational, communicative and leadership skills to guide others to find those insights interesting to them. I strongly believe that data analysis and communication is not just for experts in their respective fields, but for all those who want to know more about the subjects of their interest.
