## Privacy Policy

This policy covers how this site uses your personal information. We take your privacy seriously and will take all measures to protect your personal information.

Any personal information received will only be used to fill your order or answer your questions. I will not sell or redistribute your information to anyone.

## Cookie Policy

This is the Cookie Policy for Show 'n Tell Data Design, accessible from www.showntelldata.com

In general this site doesn't use cookies. I have no need for them, so there is no reason for you to click additional popups to accept the cookies we don't use. 

However, if you place an order through this site, some cookies are essential to ensure that your order is remembered between pages and it can be processed properly. This means that when you place an order you accept the use of those cookies to process your order. That's all.
